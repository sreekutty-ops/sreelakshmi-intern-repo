# Professionalism at Focus Bear – Reflection

## Professionalism in a Casual Work Environment
Professionalism in a casual workplace means being respectful, reliable, and accountable while still being friendly and relaxed. Professional behaviour includes clear communication, being punctual for meetings, responding thoughtfully to messages, and collaborating respectfully. Unprofessional behaviour would include ignoring messages, being dismissive, speaking disrespectfully, or not taking responsibility for assigned tasks.



## Respectful Communication in Remote Teams
In remote teams, respectful communication involves using a polite and clear tone in messages, being mindful that written communication can be easily misunderstood, and responding within a reasonable timeframe. Disagreements should be handled calmly and professionally, focusing on solutions rather than blame.



## Giving and Receiving Feedback
Professional feedback focuses on actions and outcomes, not personal traits. When receiving feedback, it’s important to listen openly, ask clarifying questions, and avoid reacting defensively. When giving feedback, assuming positive intent and being constructive helps maintain trust and collaboration.



## Reflection

### Experiences of Good Teamwork
I have experienced effective teamwork when expectations were clear, communication was open, and team members supported each other. Mutual respect and willingness to help made collaboration productive and enjoyable.

### Clear and Inclusive Communication
To ensure my communication is clear and inclusive, I will be mindful of tone, provide context when asking questions, and avoid assumptions. I will also be open to different perspectives and working styles.

### Creating a Positive Work Environment
I can help create a positive and professional environment by being kind, reliable, open to feedback, and supportive of my teammates while maintaining accountability for my responsibilities.

### Preparing for Meetings
I will prepare for meetings by reviewing relevant information beforehand, having clear questions or updates ready, and respecting everyone’s time by being punctual and focused.

### Being Proactive
Being proactive during my internship means asking questions when unsure, updating supervisors on progress, seeking feedback early, and identifying areas where I can contribute more effectively.

### Following Up and Escalation
If I need information or action from a colleague, I will follow up politely after a reasonable time. If there is still no response and the issue is blocking progress, I would escalate it to my supervisor with context. I would only escalate serious concerns when necessary.

### Things I Will Not Do
I will not engage in disrespectful behaviour, ignore feedback, create conflict, or make assumptions about others’ intentions. I will avoid unprofessional language and behaviours that could negatively affect the team.



## Safety and Escalation
I am aware that the CEO’s contact details have been shared for use in situations involving serious breaches of professional conduct or safety concerns.
