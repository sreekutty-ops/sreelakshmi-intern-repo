# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) – Laptop Ergonomics

## Why This Matters
Working long hours on a laptop without proper ergonomic support can lead to neck strain, back pain, wrist discomfort, eye strain, and long-term musculoskeletal issues. Making small adjustments to the workspace and daily habits can significantly improve comfort, posture, and productivity.


## Risks of Using a Laptop Without Ergonomic Support
- **Neck and shoulder strain** from looking down at a low screen
- **Poor posture** due to hunching over the laptop
- **Wrist and hand discomfort** from awkward keyboard angles
- **Eye strain and headaches** from prolonged screen focus
- **Lower back pain** caused by improper chair and desk height



## Ergonomic Equipment That Improves Posture
- **Laptop stand** to raise the screen to eye level
- **External keyboard and mouse** to keep wrists in a neutral position
- **External monitor** for better screen height and visibility
- **Ergonomic chair** with lower-back (lumbar) support
- **Footrest** to keep feet flat and maintain proper posture



## Healthy Desk & Monitor Setup
- Screen positioned **at or slightly below eye level**
- Chair adjusted so **feet rest flat on the floor**
- Elbows bent at roughly **90 degrees**
- Keyboard and mouse placed at **forearm height**
- Back supported and shoulders relaxed


## Daily Habits to Reduce Strain
- Follow the **20-20-20 rule** to reduce eye strain  
- Take **short movement breaks every 30–60 minutes**
- Perform **neck, shoulder, and wrist stretches**
- Sit upright and avoid slouching
- Stay hydrated throughout the day



## Reflection

### Workspace Changes I Made
I adjusted my laptop setup by raising the screen using a laptop stand and using an external keyboard and mouse. This helped me sit more upright instead of bending my neck forward.

### Behavioural Changes I Implemented
I made a conscious effort to sit with my back straight, keep my feet flat on the floor, and take short breaks to stretch and move around.

### How I Reminded Myself to Take Breaks
I used **Focus Bear’s built-in break reminders** to prompt me to stand up, stretch, and rest my eyes during the workday. This helped reduce stiffness and fatigue.


## Outcome
After making these changes, I noticed improved posture, less neck and shoulder tension, and better overall comfort during long work sessions.
