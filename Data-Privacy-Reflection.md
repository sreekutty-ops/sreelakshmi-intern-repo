# Data Privacy & Confidentiality – Reflection

## Key Takeaways from Focus Bear’s Privacy Policy
Focus Bear takes user privacy and data protection seriously. User data is collected only for legitimate purposes, stored securely, and accessed only by authorised personnel. Personal data must not be shared without consent, and all handling of data must comply with applicable privacy laws and internal policies.



## Confidential Data at Focus Bear
Confidential data includes:
- User personal information (e.g. names, emails, usage data)
- Health or behavioural data related to focus and productivity
- Internal company documents, source code, credentials, and access tokens
- Any non-public business or operational information



## Best Practices for Handling Confidential Data
- Access only the data required to perform assigned tasks
- Never share credentials, tokens, or sensitive information in public channels
- Use secure tools and approved platforms for storing and sharing data
- Lock devices when not in use and avoid using unsecured networks
- Follow the principle of least privilege



## Responding to a Data Breach or Accidental Disclosure
If a data breach or accidental disclosure is suspected, it should be reported immediately to a supervisor or appropriate company contact. The issue should not be ignored or hidden. Prompt reporting helps minimise impact and allows the company to take corrective action.



## Reflection

### Secure Data Handling in Daily Tasks
To handle data securely, I will be careful about what data I access, ensure I am using secure tools, and double-check before sharing any information. I will also keep my passwords and tokens private.

### Safe Storage, Sharing, and Disposal
Sensitive information should be stored only in approved systems, shared on a need-to-know basis, and deleted or revoked when no longer required. Temporary data should not be kept longer than necessary.

### Common Data Privacy Mistakes
Common mistakes include sharing credentials, leaving sensitive files unsecured, using personal devices or accounts improperly, and sending information to the wrong recipient. These can be avoided by staying alert, following policies, and verifying before acting.



## Security Habit to Adopt
One habit I will adopt is regularly reviewing access permissions and ensuring that credentials, tokens, or sensitive files are never shared or stored insecurely.

## Key Learning
A key learning is that protecting user trust depends on careful, responsible handling of data at all times, even during small or routine tasks.
